Apocalypse Design
=================
**Public source code and assets**


We are an Italian demoscene group active in the late 90s and early 2000. We released PC demos and PC 64K intros at various European demoparties.

Here, more than 10 years later, we are collecting everything we can find of our old demoscene-related stuff.

The code you can find on this repository is pretty outdated, badly written (often in a hurry) and you should definitely avoid reusing it. We have released this stuff only because we wanted to preserve it for our own memories, and to preserve a bit of the Italian demoscne history.
Furthermore if you can understand Italian you may find some funny comments in the source code.

Most of the C++ code has been updated and fixed to work on current PCs.
We ported all projects to *Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop* (which is a free download) and upgraded DirectX code to version 9. We have also updated third-party libraries to the latest versions.

We have not yet decided the license for this stuff - stay tuned, we will update this page shortly.
