Cubic Entropia
==============

This is the last demo released by Apocalypse Design, in July 2002, at Webb.it 2002 (Italy).
http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=6835

Includes the latest version of the RedShift 3D Engine (by Turbo).

This is the original Visual Studio 6 project, some work would be needed to make it work on current PCs (we don't even know if the source is complete).
